<h3>
<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome</h3>

<p> This web page contains all information and links regarding the upcoming Ecological Predictability Course, organised by Owen Petchey at the University of Zurich.</p>


<h3>
<a id="course-aims" class="anchor" href="#course-aims" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course aims</h3>

<p>
This week long residential course will expose students to concepts, methods, and questions concerning ecological predictability. Students will then embark on research projects closely guided by the course instructors. Aims of the course are diverse and evolving, but include:
</p>

<ul class="a">
<li>Understand why researching ecological predictability is important.</li>
<li>Understand how to research ecological predictability, including empirical and analytical methods.</li>
<li>Implement this understanding during a guided research project.</li>
<li>Publish the findings of the guided research project.</li>
</ul>


<h3>
<a id="students" class="anchor" href="#students" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who should take the course?</h3>

<p>PhD students, with an interest in learning about concepts and methods concerning ecological predictability. Some of the students should be interested and able to continue working on research projects after the workshop, with the aim to complete the project by publishing the findings in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
    
<p>Students will benefit from having at least two of the following:</p>
<li>A good conceptual grasp of population and or community ecology.</li>
<li>Well developed skills for analysis of empirical data.</li>
<li>Some experience of ecological modelling.</li>
<li>Experience working in a small team to conduct ecological research.</li>
<li>Formulating focused research questions.</li>
    

<h3>
<a id="instructors" class="anchor" href="#instructors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructors</h3>

<p>Instructors will have experience and expertise related to ecological predictability research. Each instructor will give a presentation showcasing their experience and expertise, so that students may know who can assist with what. Each presentation will end with a description about an idea for a research project. List of instructors coming soon.</p>

<h3>
<a id="guided-projects" class="anchor" href="#guided-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The guided research projects.</h3>

<p>
Projects will be proposed by instructors, who should have a clear enough idea of the project that they can be confident that a nice publication is possible, with majority of work done in the week of the workshop. Data should be compiled before the course, and instructors should know the methods well enough to be able to teach them to the students. (E.g., time consuming, complex, coding , e.g., ODEs for simulating foodweb dynamics, should be done by instructors before the course, to provide students with tools.)
</p>

<p>        
Students will self organise (perhaps with some guidance) into groups working on research projects suggested by the Instructors.
</p>

<p>
Each project will be a team composed of a project leader, a lead instructor, other instructors, and other members. The project leader will be a student on the course, with the desire, ability, and capacity to continue work on the project to completion after the workshop. The lead instructor will be the person that suggested the general subject of the research project.  
</p>

<p>
The lead instructor will mentor the project leader, and any other members as required.
</p>

<p>
The instructors will assist as required with the project with advice, and may perform limited parts of the research.
</p>

<p>
Collaborative research via a platform such as github will be encouraged and supported.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="registration-etc" class="anchor" href="#registration-etc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Registration, fees, location, etc.</h3>

<p>
Applications welcomed from PhD students with a strong interest in ecological predictability research. PhD students in the Ecology PhD programme of the Life Science Zurich Graduate School will be given priority, followed by students from other programmes and Universities.
