<p class="italic">    
"Forecasts are statements about what the future may hold in store (Coreau et al. 2009), and are useful for all kinds of decision-making, including in economic, political and personal spheres. Ecological examples include forecasts of species distributions (e.g. Guisan & Thuiller 2005), functional diversity (e.g. Kooistra et al. 2008; Schimel et al. 2013), phenology (e.g. Cannell & Smith 1983; Diez et al. 2012), population size (e.g. Ward et al. 2014), species invasions (e.g. Levine & Antonio 2003), agricultural yield (e.g. Cane et al. 1994), pollinator performance (e.g. Corbet et al. 1995), extinction risk (e.g. Gotelli & Ellison 2006a), fishery dynamics (e.g. Hare et al. 2010; Travis et al. 2014), water quality (e.g. Komatsu et al. 2007), forest carbon dynamics (e.g. Gao et al. 2011), ecosystem services (e.g. Homolová et al. 2013), disease dynamics (e.g. Ollerenshaw & Smith 1969) and interspecific interactions (e.g. Pearse & Altermatt 2013).

Although forecasting has been part of ecology for decades, current and expected environmental change is motivating ever increasing interest in ecological forecasting. There is a pressing need to deliver information about the probable future state of populations, communities and ecosystems to better inform conservation, management and adaptation strategies (Clark et al. 2001; Sutherland et al. 2006; Tallis & Kareiva 2006; Evans 2012; Mouquet et al. 2012; Purves et al. 2013). Furthermore, accurate forecasting (i.e. correct prediction) is sometimes regarded as the hallmark of successful science (Evans et al. 2012), and as such can be a powerful driver of advances in knowledge about how ecological systems work (Coreau et al. 2009)." (Quoted from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12443/abstract"> Petchey et al (2015) Ecology Letters. </a>
  </p>  
    
    <p> Ecological predictability concerns how well we can forecast. Many factors can contribute to high or low predictability, such as high certainty in important processes, or chaotic dynamics, respectively. Ecological predictability is a wide ranging area of ecological research, often requiring merging of observation, experiment, and theory, and other fields such as evolutionary biology. This <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12443/abstract"> Ecology Letters article </a> gives some examples of and perspectives on ecological predictability research.</p>

<a id="course-aims" class="anchor" href="#course-aims" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Course aims</h3>

<p>
This week long residential course will expose students to concepts, methods, and questions concerning ecological predictability. Students will then embark on research projects closely guided by the course instructors. Aims of the course are diverse and evolving, but include:
</p>

<ul class="a">
<li>Understand why researching ecological predictability is important.</li>
<li>Understand how to research ecological predictability, including empirical and analytical methods.</li>
<li>Implement this understanding during a guided research project.</li>
<li>Publish the findings of the guided research project.</li>
</ul>


<h3>
<a id="students" class="anchor" href="#students" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who should take the course?</h3>

<p>PhD students, with an interest in learning about concepts and methods concerning ecological predictability. Some of the students should be interested and able to continue working on research projects after the workshop, with the aim to complete the project by publishing the findings in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
    
<p>Students will benefit from having at least two of the following:</p>
<li>A good conceptual grasp of population, community, and or ecosystem ecology.</li>
<li>Well developed skills for analysis of empirical data.</li>
<li>Some experience of ecological modelling.</li>
<li>Experience working in a small team to conduct ecological research.</li>
<li>Formulating focused research questions.</li>
    

<h3>
<a id="instructors" class="anchor" href="#instructors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructors</h3>

<p>Instructors will have experience and expertise related to ecological predictability research. Each instructor will give a presentation showcasing their experience and expertise, so that students may know who can assist with what, and giving some inspiration about possible research projects. List of instructors coming soon.</p>

<h3>
<a id="guided-projects" class="anchor" href="#guided-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The guided research projects.</h3>

<p>
In order to foster creativity in a safe environment, there will be two approaches to students defining the research project they will work on:
<li>Based on the instructor presentations, prior knowledge, new ideas, and any other sources of inspiration, students will come up with ideas for research projects to be conducted during the course.</li>
<li>Independently, before the course, instructors will formulate ideas for projects, including some preparation of data and tools (e.g., time consuming, complex, coding , e.g., ODEs for simulating foodweb dynamics) such that the project can be reasonably completed during the course. These projects will be available to students.
</p>
    
<p>        
Students will self organise (perhaps with some guidance) into working groups, each of which focuses on single research project.
</p>

<p>
Each working group will be a team composed of a project leader, a lead instructor, other instructors, and other members. The project leader will be a student on the course, with the desire, ability, and capacity to continue work on the project to completion after the workshop. The lead instructor will be the person that suggested the general subject of the research project.  
</p>

<p>
The lead instructor will mentor the project leader, and any other members as required.
</p>

<p>
The instructors will assist as required with the project with advice, and may perform limited parts of the research.
</p>

<p>
Collaborative research via a platform such as github will be encouraged and supported.
</p>
